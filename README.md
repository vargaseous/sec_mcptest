# Demonstration of a Streamlit app and MCP server

This setup allows external applications (mainly desktop LLM clients with MCP support, such as Claude Desktop and LM Studio) to control a Streamlit dashboard (an explorer of Singapore health facilities data from OpenStreetMap) through an MCP server.

This repository was prepared as part of a demonstration on Model Context Protocol (MCP) and agentic coding assistants (such as Claude Code and OpenAI Codex) for National Coding Week at the Singapore-ETH Centre.

## Architecture

1. **Streamlit App** (`main.py`) - The web interface
2. **FastAPI Server** (`api_server.py`) - REST API for state management
3. **Redis** - Shared state storage and pub/sub
4. **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`) - Tools for external clients (Claude Desktop / LM Studio)
   - Alternative implementation: `mcp_server_fastmcp.py` (uses fastmcp)

## Docs

- MCP overview: `docs/mcp_overview.md`
- FastMCP how-to: `docs/fastmcp_guide.md`

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

2. Install and start Redis:
```bash
# macOS
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

## Running the System

Start each component in its own terminal (order doesn‚Äôt matter, but all three should be running before using MCP tools):

1. Start Redis (if not running as a service):
```bash
redis-server
```

2. Start FastAPI server:
```bash
uv run api-server
```

Alternative:
```bash
python api_server.py
```

3. Start Streamlit app:
```bash
uv run streamlit run main.py
```

4. (Optional) Test MCP server directly:
```bash
uv run mcp-server
```

Alternative (fastmcp implementation):
```bash
uv run mcp-server-fast
```

## Available MCP Tools

- `get_app_state` ‚Äî Get current filters and map view
- `list_facility_classes` ‚Äî List valid `fclass` values from the dataset
- `set_facility_filters` ‚Äî Control visible facility types
- `set_map_view` ‚Äî Set map center and zoom level
- `reset_app` ‚Äî Reset to default state
- `check_health` ‚Äî Verify API‚ÜîRedis connectivity

## Prerequisites for All Integrations

- Python environment set up with `uv sync` and the virtual env located at `.venv/` (created by `uv`).
- Redis, FastAPI server, and Streamlit app running locally as shown above.
- Verify API health before connecting a client:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Expect: {"status":"healthy","redis":"connected"}
```

## Integration: Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop supports configuring MCP servers via a JSON file. This project can generate a portable config that auto-detects your project path and virtual environment.

1) Generate portable config (recommended):
```bash
uv run python mcp_server.py --config
```

Copy the printed JSON into your Claude Desktop config file. Typical locations:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2) Manual config (if you prefer editing by hand):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "streamlit-controller": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/project/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/project/mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/project"
    }
  }
}
```

3) Use it in Claude:
- Ensure Redis, API, and Streamlit are running.
- Open Claude Desktop and start a new chat.
- Ask Claude to use the `streamlit-controller` tools, e.g.:
  - "Use get_app_state"
  - "Set the map center to 1.3521, 103.8198 with zoom 13"

Troubleshooting (Claude):
- If tools are not listed, recheck the `command`, `args`, and `cwd` paths.
- Ensure `uv run api-server` is running and `curl http://localhost:8000/health` returns healthy.
- If Redis isn‚Äôt running, the API health will show `"redis":"disconnected"`.

## Integration: ChatGPT Desktop

ChatGPT Desktop does not currently support adding custom MCP servers. Use Claude Desktop or LM Studio instead.

---

## Integration: LM Studio (tested on 0.3.25)

Follow these steps to register the MCP server:

1) Open the MCP configuration editor:
- Click the wrench icon (top-right) ‚Üí Program.
- Click Install (to enable the MCP integration if prompted).
- Click Edit mcp.json.

2) Add the server to `mcp.json` (example):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "streamlit-controller": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/project/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/project/mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/project"
    }
  }
}
```

3) Save the file, then in LM Studio start a chat and invoke tools after ensuring Redis, API, and Streamlit are running.

Troubleshooting (LM Studio 0.3.25):
- If tools don‚Äôt show up, re-open the Program panel and ensure MCP is installed/enabled.
- Verify paths in `mcp.json` are absolute and the `.venv` has dependencies (`uv sync`).
- Check the API health at `http://localhost:8000/health` and confirm Redis is connected.

Examples of models tested and reported to work:
- google/gemma-3-12b
- qwen/qwen3-1.7b
- qwen/qwen3-4b-2507
- qwen/qwen3-4b-thinking-2507

üçé On a MacBook Pro 14-inch with M2 Pro:
- Qwen3-4B-2507 balanced performance and instruction-following.
- However, even Qwen3-1.7B sufficed for most use cases, and runs comfortably alongside other apps.

## Usage Examples

Once connected from any MCP client:
- "Show only hospitals on the map"
- "Zoom in on the central area"
- "Reset the app to show all facilities"
- "Center the map on coordinates 1.3521, 103.8198"

## Troubleshooting (General)

- API not healthy:
  - Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping` ‚Üí `PONG`
  - Check API logs where you ran `uv run api-server`
- Port conflicts:
  - API uses `:8000`. Change in `api_server.py` if needed and update clients accordingly.
- Wrong Python/paths:
  - Use absolute paths to `.venv/bin/python`, `mcp_server.py`, and project root.
- Dependencies:
  - Reinstall if needed: `uv sync`
